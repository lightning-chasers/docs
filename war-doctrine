A witty Companion 

The most important philosophy of warfare is to not become your own enemy. 
If you surround and inundate your enemy, what strategies or tactics will you need any further?

The most important rule of warfare is compassion. Compassion will help you avoid warfare. You must have compassion not only for yourself and for your allies but also for your enemy. The universe is dynamic and the concepts of friend and foe are not in the least bit static. If you do not have compassion for your friends and treat them coldly or use them ruthlessly, they will turn into foes. If you preemptively kill your friends knowing that they could turn into foes, you will lose all your friends. If you treat a foe without compassion you will embolden them and if you kill them, you will lose the potential of having a valuable friend. As such, not having compassion will cause you to become your own enemy.  
 
The second most important rule of warfare is patience. Patience will help you avoid warfare. If you have been attacked then retaliating without strategy, tactical advantages and proper supplies will take you to your doom. Patiently study the attacker, excavate their motives if possible (this will help you understand their mental weaknesses), make sure that you are not being drawn out through petty provocations and make sure that you do not become the victim of a "false flag attack" lead from amongst your so called friends. When attacking: wait for opportunities, wait till your opponent lowers their guard, wait for strengthening of your own forces by giving them a sense of hope, rest, nourishment, and medication. Avoid above all else, repeated long battles. All these chores require utmost patience. As such, not having patience will cause you to become your own enemy. 
 
The third most important rule of warfare is forgiveness. Forgiveness will help you avoid warfare. Quick and unplanned retaliation is a dire weakness and apart from this kind of retaliation, any other kind will never bring you a sense of solace, peace or closure. Forgiving your enemy for their crimes against you and the ecology by not retaliating is a way of forgiving yourself from the crimes of warfare that you could have committed against all creation. You are certainly a greater being if you forgive an attacker and such an act of courage and valor may go unnoticed by petty fiends or ignoble mortals. You merely need to recognize that all in all, every act of goodness and kindness goes unwasted in The Eternal's Perview and Light. 

Be cognizant that in the comparison between fragrance and stench, it simply isn't within the design of fragrance to overpower stench. But it is indeed within the design of stench to defile and overpower fragrance. If fragrance were to even attempt to become forceful and unforgiving by copying any bit of stench, it would invariably lose its subtlety and nobility while devolving into stench. 
As such, not having any sense of reconciliation, mercy or forgiveness will cause you to become something worse than your own enemy — a loathsome enemy to all.  
Not avoiding warfare is already a way to become your own enemy. War is all consuming, all encompassing and completely devoid of dignity and honor. There is no such thing as just war or holy war or earnest war. However, if you must war (yes I'm using war as a verb here) out of compulsion, then you must know that you will invariably copy the nature of stench and will risk every being in this universe. However, you may end up choosing to devolve into stench perhaps with a hope or a wish to cause the least amount of loss and destruction to the very existence of compassion, patience and forgiveness within the world’s ecology. 
It is certainly true that all parties lose in a war including those who think they have no stake in other people's conflicts. Especially, the by-standing unassuming ones who get classified as "collateral damage" are the most tragic casualties of war. So be emphatically concerned about the well being of those simple people who want nothing to do with combat because if even you don't do so, then there will remain no one else left to discern the qualities of fragrance and only stench will prevail in this realm. 
So if you detect a war, you can voluntarily go ahead and bring an end to it while preserving as much care, fortitude, compassion, patience and mercy as possible, amongst all beings within all realms, so as to never turn into stench like the rest of warmongers.

Be fragrance unto the world my love, 
be kind, be caring, be patient, 
be forgiving and, most significantly, 
of all, 
be!
